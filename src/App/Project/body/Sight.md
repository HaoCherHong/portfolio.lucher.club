# SIGHT

"SIGHT." is my project for a game design course in the college. In the semester, we, 4 other team members and I as lead developer and project manager, had to design and develop a game and attend a game making contest. The character have a special ability, "SIGHT.", that enables him to "see" the sight of monitor cameras. "SIGHT." is a first-person stealth game, player have to use his special ability to trick monitor cameras and steal the objectives.

In order to make the visual effects for "SIGHT.", we had to design and implement a lot of shaders to create the amazing game graphics. Since the stage design is important to this game, we also made custom editors to create our stages. For example, we have editors for previewing camera sights, previewing character's holding gestures, etc.
