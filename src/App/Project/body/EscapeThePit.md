Escape the Pit is a little game I made (from designing to developing) in 2011-2012.
Player should control the character and keep him jumping up to pass the stage or survive. The character is able to jump, run and fire a hook to pull himself up to another platform.

This is one of my most important developing experience, because I don't have any mate to help me with 3D models so I have to learn to make them by myself, including modeling, skinning, texturing, rigging and even animating. Also, making a complete game by myself, I earned much experiences and skills of Unity game developing.
