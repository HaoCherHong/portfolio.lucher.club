# CCBC

CCBC is an Facebook anonymous posts service for NTUT students. Users can write down their posts on the service website anonymously and the server will process it to images then post them to our Facebook Page automatically.

The service not only supports posting but also replying. Users can choose which post to be replied and which "character" they want to reply with.
