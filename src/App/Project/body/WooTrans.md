# WooTrans

WooTrans is an web-session manager for WooTalk service. Since WooTalk only allows you to chat with one person at a time, with this extension, you can switch between different conversations in one click. More importantly, since WooTrans uses your Google account storage, you can switch to conversations on other devices logged with the same Google account.
