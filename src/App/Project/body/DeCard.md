# De-Card

We all have that friend that we no longer want us to be connected on Facebook, but didn't unfriend him / her. For fear of hurting someone's fealing, we keep the friendship there. Write down your De-Card. Your De-Card will stay private unless you both write down De-Card to each other.

# Open De-Cards

In order to get more users, I let users choose to share their De-Card to public anonymously. Once they checked to allow me to share their de-card, I can see their de-card at admin panel and share them. I also opened a [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/decard.to/) to promote the service.
